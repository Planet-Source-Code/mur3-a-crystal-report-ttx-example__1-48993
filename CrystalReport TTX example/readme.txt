a Crystal Report TTX example

Shows how to create a report using TTX files, that is you dont need to specify a fixed database for your report. It'll be based on a simple TTX file. Using this you can pass an ADO recordset to the report at runtime. This method solves great deal of problems for many crystal programmers who will benefit from the simplicity of intergrating their report with VB. The report will execute even if the database location changes or renamed. Only you hav to do is change the connection from VB.

[supports versions 8 & above.]
